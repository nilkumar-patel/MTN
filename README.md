# What to improve
- UI must be finalize before start working on it.
- email and password validation pattern must be define.
- validation must be trigger on blur and onchange.
- For only login form we should not use store and just faching data with server.
- user lazy load module.
- for store files should be in proper folder structure.
- use proper coding and commenting practice.
- use tslint for typechecking and mantaing the code for better readbility.
